<h1>About us</h1>

<div class="musichub">
  <h2>Surrey Music Hub is a network of music organisations and schools working together to bring more musical opportunities to more young people in Surrey, both in schools and in the wider community.

We’re led by Surrey Arts, the county council’s arts service, which includes the schools music service. Together, we’re making sure that children and young people receive music education that is high quality, wide ranging, sustainable and accessible to all, with clear routes for learning and options for musical progression.

Music Hubs have been created across the UK as part of the government’s National Plan for Music Education.

It means that we’re now required to work in partnership with other music organisations and musicians, to reach more children and young people, and make sure that we are all truly meeting their needs.

Currently, the main partners in the Hub are Surrey Arts, the county council’s music and arts service; Schools; Rhythmix, one of the UK’s leading music charities; Arts Partnership Surrey (the partnership of district, borough and county councils) and the Yehudi Menuhin School. As always, we’ll be working with many others, according to what’s needed.</h2>
